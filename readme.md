First i want to see how hard i can push a mobile device, i need to replicate the screens of EspectroAudible in GLSL

At the moment i did a texture to pass Frequency (in channel R) and TimeDomain (in channel G) of the song

I have an aproach to an osciloscope in GLSL, its a start but needs more work...

You can drop a song of your hard disk into the experience to use it.
